Convert DPR versions of single hop datasets to "MDR" format to faciliate adding to training to bolster SQUAD-open retrieval performance

First download copies of the relevant files using the links found in https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR/blob/main/dpr/data/download_data.py
Then extract to their json form.

Most leaves are flattened and have distinct upper (') and lower (') surfaces that differ in color, hairiness, the number of stomata (pores that intake and output gases), the amount and structure of epicuticular wax and other features.
