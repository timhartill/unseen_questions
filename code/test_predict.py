She was given to one of their warriors as a spoil of war. Tem\u00fcjin was deeply distressed by the abduction of his wife and remarked that his \"bed was made empty\" and his \"breast was torn apart\". Tem\u00fcjin rescued her several months later with the aid of his allies Wang Khan and Jamukha. Many scholars describe this event as one of the key crossroads in Tem\u00fcjin\u2019s life, which moved him along the path towards becoming a conqueror. \u201cAs the pillaging and plundering went on, Tem\u00fcjin moved among the people that were hurriedly escaping, calling, \u2018B\u00f6rte, B\u00f6rte!\u2019 And so he came upon her, for Lady B\u00f6rte was among those fleeing people. She heard the voice of Tem\u00fcjin and, recognizing it, she got off the cart and came running towards him. Although it was still night, Lady B\u00f6rte and Qo\u2019aq\u010din both recognized Tem\u00fcjin\u2019s reins and tether and grabbed them. It was moonlight; he looked at them, recognized Lady B\u00f6rte, and they fell into each other\u2019s arms.\u201d -The Secret History of the Mongols B\u00f6rte was held captive for eight months, and gave birth to Jochi soon after she was rescued. This left doubt as to who the father of the child was, because her captor took her as a \"wife\" and could have possibly impregnated her. Despite this, Tem\u00fcjin let Jochi remain in the family and claimed him as his own son. B\u00f6rte had three more sons, Chagatai (1183\u20131242), \u00d6gedei (1186\u20131241), and Tolui (1191\u20131232). Tem\u00fcjin had many other children with other wives, but they were excluded from succession, only B\u00f6rte's sons could be considered to be his heirs."
