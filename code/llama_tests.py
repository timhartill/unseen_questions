Write a truthful, factual explanation to help answer the question, then answer the question.

Q: Greece is larger than mexico?
A: Greece is approximately 131,957 sq km, while Mexico is approximately 1,964,375 sq km, making Mexico 1,389% larger than Greece. So the answer is no.
Q: Tools can be made of wood, iron, plastic amongst other things. Iron tools historically replaced what?
A: Historically, iron tools were first used in the Iron Age. The Iron Age followed the Bronze Age. Thus, iron tools replacing bronze tools makes most sense. So the answer is bronze tools.
Q: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?
A: Arthur's Magazine was an American literary periodical first published 1844. First for Women is a woman's magazine that started in 1989. So the answer is Arthur's Magazine.
Q: Glasses always fog up?
A: Condensation occurs on eyeglass lenses when water vapor from your sweat, breath, and ambient humidity lands on a cold surface, cools, and then changes into tiny drops of liquid, forming a film that you see as fog. Your lenses will be relatively cool compared to your breath when the outside air is cold but not when the air is warm. So the answer is no.
Q: Water flows downhill and tends to collect in low-lying areas such as valleys and holes. Lakes are usually large bodies of fresh water. Where is a lake likely to be found?
A: The answer must be somewhere that a lot of water can collect. A valley is likely to be able to collect enough water. So the answer is a valley.
Q: Foxes are predators whose natural habitat is the forest. They have also been known to eat chickens from people's properties. The fox walked from the city into the forest, what was it looking for?
A: The answer must be a reason for a fox to go into the forest. The forest is a fox’s natural habitat. So the answer is natural habitat.
Q: A fish is capable of thinking?
A: Fish are more intelligent than they appear. In many areas, such as memory, their cognitive powers match or exceed those of ’higher’ vertebrates including non-human primates. Fish’s long-term memories help them keep track of complex social relationships. So the answer is yes.
Q: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
A: Milhouse Mussolini van Houten is a fictional character featured in the tv series "The Simpsons" created by Matt Groening. He named the character after President Richard Nixon's middle name. So the answer is President Richard Nixon.
Q: What is the largest annual event held in the birthplace of the performer who sang Let Me Tell You About the Birds and the Bees?
A: The Birds and the Bees was a 1964 single release by Jewel Akens. Jewel Akens was born in Houston, Texas, USA. The largest annual event in Houston is the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. So the answer is Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
Q: A common effect of smoking lots of cigarettes in one’s lifetime is a higher than normal chance of getting lung cancer?
A: Those who consistently averaged less than one cigarette per day over their lifetime had nine times the risk of dying from lung cancer than non-smokers. Among people who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes per day, the risk of dying from lung cancer was nearly 12 times higher than that of non-smokers. So the answer is yes.
Q: Fred owns a number of things including a baseball bat, a laptop, a tablet and a briefcase. Fred works a long way from his home, so which electronic device would Fred prefer to walk to work with?
A: Electronic devices include tablets and laptops. Tablets are lighter than laptops and lighter things are easier than heavier things to carry. Thus, a tablet is the easiest device for Fred to carry. So the answer is tablet.
Q: Chang Ucchin was born in korea during a time that ended with the conclusion of what?
A: Chang Ucchin was born when Korea was still under Japanese colonial rule. Korea under Japanese rule began 1910 and ended at the conclusion of World War II in 1945. So the answer is World War II.
Q: A rock is the same size as a pebble?
A: A pebble is a clast of rock with a particle size of 4 to 64 millimetres based on the Udden-Wentworth scale of sedimentology. Pebbles are generally considered larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than cobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter). So the answer is no.
Q: When did the birth state of Kevin Sessums become a right to work state?
A: Kevin Sessums was born in 1956 in Forest, Mississippi. The Right to work law was adopted by Mississipi in 1954. So the answer is 1954.

### Human: Write a truthful, factual explanation to help answer the question, then answer the question.

### Human: Since the end of World War II, in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The U.S. helped establish the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  and later the World Trade Organization ; although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s . Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement  in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements . In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community  in 1951 which became the European Economic Community  in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the European Union  in 1993. The European Union, now the world's largest single market, has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world. How many years did the European Coal and Steel Community exist?
### Assistant: According to the passage, the European Coal and Steel Community was established in 1951 and became the EEC in 1958. 1958 - 1951 = 7. So the answer is 7.
### Human: After the death of his older half-brother and financial support, Carl Erik, when Lars Levi was only a teenager, Laestadius mourned the deaths of his mother in 1824, his dad in 1832, and his younger brother Petrus in 1841.  At least two of Laestadius's own sons predeceased him as well . Around 1833 Laestadius suffered from an ailment which the doctors first thought was pneumonia. He recovered. In the 1840s, Laestadius suffered from severe typhoid fever and later tuberculosis.  Towards the end of his life, Laestadius experienced "impending blindness" and contracted a cholera-like illness. How many family member deaths did Laestadius experience?
### Assistant: Family member deaths were his older half-brother, his mother, his dad, his younger brother and two sons. These add up to 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. So the answer is 6.
### Human: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Colts, the Broncos went home for a Week 5 divisional duel with the San Diego Chargers.  In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as Chargers QB Philip Rivers got a 2-yard TD run, while LB Brandon Siler returned a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, the Chargers continued its offensive revival with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 26-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Broncos would get their only score of the game, as kicker Jason Elam got a 30-yard field goal.  San Diego would end the half with Kaeding nailing a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver continued to get pounded with Rivers completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates and a 15-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson.  In the fourth quarter, San Diego sealed their victory with RB Michael Turner getting a 74-yard TD run for the only score of the period. With their third-straight loss, not only did the Broncos fall to 2-3 entering their bye week, but the loss marked their worse home loss since losing to the Kansas City Chiefs 56-10 on Oct 23, 1966.  The 38-point deficit also marked Denver's worst home loss since the AFL-NFL merger. Which player scored the third longest touchdown?
### Assistant: All the touchdowns are: A 2-yard touchdown by Philip Rogers, a 23-yard touchdown by Brandom Siler, a 9-yard touchdown by Antonio Gates, a 15-yard touchdown by Vincent Jackson, a 74-yard touchdown by Michael Turner. The third longest is the 15-yard touchdown by Vincent Jackson. So the answer is Vincent Jackson.
### Human: Hoping to continue their winning streak, the Bears flew to Cowboys Stadium for an NFC matchup with the Cowboys. In the first quarter Chicago took the early lead as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 38-yard field goal. Then they trailed with WR Dez Bryant returning a punt 62 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. While the Cowboys were able to pressure quarterback Jay Cutler in the early stages of the game, the Bears' offense made adjustments and regained momentum.  The Bears got the lead back when Cutler made a 39-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. In the second quarter the Bears trailed again when QB Tony Romo made a 1-yard touchdown pass to RB Chris Gronkowski, but took the lead with Cutler making a nine-yard TD pass to WR Devin Hester. The Bears increased their lead when kicker Robbie Gould made a 40-yard field goal. In the third quarter Dallas would reply with kicker David Buehler nailing a 28-yard field goal. The Bears increased their lead in the fourth quarter when Cutler made a three-yard TD pass to RB Matt Forte. The Cowboys made the final score of the game with Buehler hitting a 48-yard field goal.

### Human: On 25 June 1656, Charles X Gustav signed an alliance with Brandenburg: the Treaty of Marienburg granted Greater Poland to Frederick William in return for military aid. While the Brandenburgian elector was free of Swedish vassalage in Greater Poland, he remained a Swedish vassal for the Duchy of Prussia. Brandenburgian garrisons then replaced the Swedish ones in Greater Poland, who went to reinforce Charles X Gustav's army. On 29 June however, Warsaw was stormed by John II Casimir, who had drawn up to Charles X Gustav with a force of 28,500 regulars and a noble levy of 18,000 to 20,000. Thereupon, Brandenburg actively participated in the war on the Swedish side, prompting John II Casimir Vasa to state that while his Tartars already had the Swedes for breakfast, he would now take Frederick William into custody, where neither sun nor moon would shine. Already in May 1656, Alexis of Russia had declared war on Sweden, taking advantage of Charles being bound in Poland, and Livonia, Estonia and Ingria secured only by a Livonian army of 2,200 infantry and 400 dragoons, Magnus de la Gardie's 7,000 men in Prussia, and 6,933 men dispersed in garrisons along the Eastern Baltic coast. Alexis invaded Livonia in July with 35,000 men and took Dünaburg. How many months passed between Alexis of Russia declared the war on Sweden and Charles X signed an alliance with Brandenburg?

### Human: On 25 June 1656, Charles X Gustav signed an alliance with Brandenburg: the Treaty of Marienburg granted Greater Poland to Frederick William in return for military aid. While the Brandenburgian elector was free of Swedish vassalage in Greater Poland, he remained a Swedish vassal for the Duchy of Prussia. Brandenburgian garrisons then replaced the Swedish ones in Greater Poland, who went to reinforce Charles X Gustav's army. On 29 June however, Warsaw was stormed by John II Casimir, who had drawn up to Charles X Gustav with a force of 28,500 regulars and a noble levy of 18,000 to 20,000. Thereupon, Brandenburg actively participated in the war on the Swedish side, prompting John II Casimir Vasa to state that while his Tartars already had the Swedes for breakfast, he would now take Frederick William into custody, where neither sun nor moon would shine. Already in May 1656, Alexis of Russia had declared war on Sweden, taking advantage of Charles being bound in Poland, and Livonia, Estonia and Ingria secured only by a Livonian army of 2,200 infantry and 400 dragoons, Magnus de la Gardie's 7,000 men in Prussia, and 6,933 men dispersed in garrisons along the Eastern Baltic coast. Alexis invaded Livonia in July with 35,000 men and took Dünaburg. How many months passed between Alexis of Russia declared the war on Sweden and Charles X signed an alliance with Brandenburg?

### Human: Since the end of World War II, in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The U.S. helped establish the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  and later the World Trade Organization ; although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s . Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement  in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements . In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community  in 1951 which became the European Economic Community  in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states.

Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement  in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements . In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community  in 1951 which became the European Economic Community  in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the European Union  in 1993. The European Union, now the world's largest single market, has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world. How many years did the European Coal and Steel Community exist?
### Assistant: According to the passage, the European Coal and Steel Community was established in 1951 and became the EEC in 1958. 1958 - 1951 = 7. So the answer is 7.
### Human: After the death of his older half-brother and financial support, Carl Erik, when Lars Levi was only a teenager, Laestadius mourned the deaths of his mother in 1824, his dad in 1832, and his younger brother Petrus in 1841.  At least two of Laestadius's own sons predeceased him as well . Around 1833 Laestadius suffered from an ailment which the doctors first thought was pneumonia. He recovered. In the 1840s, Laestadius suffered from severe typhoid fever and later tuberculosis.  Towards the end of his life, Laestadius experienced "impending blindness" and contracted a cholera-like illness. How many family member deaths did Laestadius experience?
### Assistant: Family member deaths were his older half-brother, his mother, his dad, his younger brother and two sons. These add up to 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. So the answer is 6.
### Human: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Colts, the Broncos went home for a Week 5 divisional duel with the San Diego Chargers.  In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as Chargers QB Philip Rivers got a 2-yard TD run, while LB Brandon Siler returned a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown.

In the fourth quarter, San Diego sealed their victory with RB Michael Turner getting a 74-yard TD run for the only score of the period. With their third-straight loss, not only did the Broncos fall to 2-3 entering their bye week, but the loss marked their worse home loss since losing to the Kansas City Chiefs 56-10 on Oct 23, 1966.  The 38-point deficit also marked Denver's worst home loss since the AFL-NFL merger. Which player scored the third longest touchdown?
### Assistant: All the touchdowns are: A 2-yard touchdown by Philip Rogers, a 23-yard touchdown by Brandom Siler, a 9-yard touchdown by Antonio Gates, a 15-yard touchdown by Vincent Jackson, a 74-yard touchdown by Michael Turner. The third longest is the 15-yard touchdown by Vincent Jackson. So the answer is Vincent Jackson.
