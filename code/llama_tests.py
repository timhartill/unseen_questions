Write a truthful, factual explanation to help answer the question, then answer the question.

Q: Greece is larger than mexico?
A: Greece is approximately 131,957 sq km, while Mexico is approximately 1,964,375 sq km, making Mexico 1,389% larger than Greece. So the answer is no.
Q: Tools can be made of wood, iron, plastic amongst other things. Iron tools historically replaced what?
A: Historically, iron tools were first used in the Iron Age. The Iron Age followed the Bronze Age. Thus, iron tools replacing bronze tools makes most sense. So the answer is bronze tools.
Q: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?
A: Arthur's Magazine was an American literary periodical first published 1844. First for Women is a woman's magazine that started in 1989. So the answer is Arthur's Magazine.
Q: Glasses always fog up?
A: Condensation occurs on eyeglass lenses when water vapor from your sweat, breath, and ambient humidity lands on a cold surface, cools, and then changes into tiny drops of liquid, forming a film that you see as fog. Your lenses will be relatively cool compared to your breath when the outside air is cold but not when the air is warm. So the answer is no.
Q: Water flows downhill and tends to collect in low-lying areas such as valleys and holes. Lakes are usually large bodies of fresh water. Where is a lake likely to be found?
A: The answer must be somewhere that a lot of water can collect. A valley is likely to be able to collect enough water. So the answer is a valley.
Q: Foxes are predators whose natural habitat is the forest. They have also been known to eat chickens from people's properties. The fox walked from the city into the forest, what was it looking for?
A: The answer must be a reason for a fox to go into the forest. The forest is a fox’s natural habitat. So the answer is natural habitat.
Q: A fish is capable of thinking?
A: Fish are more intelligent than they appear. In many areas, such as memory, their cognitive powers match or exceed those of ’higher’ vertebrates including non-human primates. Fish’s long-term memories help them keep track of complex social relationships. So the answer is yes.
Q: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
A: Milhouse Mussolini van Houten is a fictional character featured in the tv series "The Simpsons" created by Matt Groening. He named the character after President Richard Nixon's middle name. So the answer is President Richard Nixon.
Q: What is the largest annual event held in the birthplace of the performer who sang Let Me Tell You About the Birds and the Bees?
A: The Birds and the Bees was a 1964 single release by Jewel Akens. Jewel Akens was born in Houston, Texas, USA. The largest annual event in Houston is the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. So the answer is Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
Q: A common effect of smoking lots of cigarettes in one’s lifetime is a higher than normal chance of getting lung cancer?
A: Those who consistently averaged less than one cigarette per day over their lifetime had nine times the risk of dying from lung cancer than non-smokers. Among people who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes per day, the risk of dying from lung cancer was nearly 12 times higher than that of non-smokers. So the answer is yes.
Q: Fred owns a number of things including a baseball bat, a laptop, a tablet and a briefcase. Fred works a long way from his home, so which electronic device would Fred prefer to walk to work with?
A: Electronic devices include tablets and laptops. Tablets are lighter than laptops and lighter things are easier than heavier things to carry. Thus, a tablet is the easiest device for Fred to carry. So the answer is tablet.
Q: Chang Ucchin was born in korea during a time that ended with the conclusion of what?
A: Chang Ucchin was born when Korea was still under Japanese colonial rule. Korea under Japanese rule began 1910 and ended at the conclusion of World War II in 1945. So the answer is World War II.
Q: A rock is the same size as a pebble?
A: A pebble is a clast of rock with a particle size of 4 to 64 millimetres based on the Udden-Wentworth scale of sedimentology. Pebbles are generally considered larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than cobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter). So the answer is no.
Q: When did the birth state of Kevin Sessums become a right to work state?
A: Kevin Sessums was born in 1956 in Forest, Mississippi. The Right to work law was adopted by Mississipi in 1954. So the answer is 1954.
